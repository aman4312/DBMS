key->non key(must exist)
part of the key->non key (nhi hona chaihye) if true then 2nf
non key-> non key (nhi hona chaihye) if true then 3nf
Needs of normalization :
  we remove anomalies(the anamolies are :
                                1.Insertion
                                2.Deletion
                                3.Updation
  and reduce redundancy 
 
1nf : Each cell in table must be atmoic(single valued)

Shortcut:
1. if data is not given then table is in 1nf.
2.if we have single attribute keys then table is 2nf
3.if all atributes are prime attributes then 3nf
4.if we have simple (single keys in table and table is in 3nf then it is bcnf
